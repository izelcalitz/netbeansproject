Hi Izelle,

To follow up on today's interview, if you're willing to proceed, I would like for you to do a second practical part.

I've attached a couple of CSV files to this email.

In these files, you'll find information for a product list, the prices for those products and then a file which contain a list of quantities for a random selection of those items.

What I would like you to do, is using the information provided, generate an output file based on the quantity lists.
You will also need to add 15% VAT to all individual prices.
This means, the price information provided is the price excluding VAT.

The output file should contain:

A line for each item showing:
id
description
quantity
unit price excluding VAT
total price excluding VAT
total VAT
total price including VAT
A summary at the end showing:
total price excluding VAT
total VAT
total price including VAT

This should all be done in java.

Once you are done, I would then like you to upload your finished solution to a GIT repository, and then send me a link to that repository.


If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

I would like a final submission by Tuesday afternoon if possible, please.


Regards,
Jonathan
